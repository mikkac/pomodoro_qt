# Pomodoro Qt 
## Introduction
This repository contains simple Pomodoro application made with Qt.
Pomodoro is well-known technique increasing productivity. It's very simple and it depends on dividing work into 'small'
intervals (work, short break and long break). This application helps to track those cycles.

## Customise 
This application is very simple, but it allows for customise of intervals times which can achieved thanks to settings widget.
Customisable variables:
* work interval time length in minutes (20 by default)
* short break time length in minutes (5 by default)
* long break time length in minutes (20 by default)
* pomodoros before long break (number of work intervals before long break) (4 by default)

## Improvements
Things that can be done in order to make this application more robust and usable:
* make it installable (add exec to /usr, move settings file to some safe place, etc.)
* add icons for exec and notification window
* add sound alarm on transitions between modes
