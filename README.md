# Pomodoro Qt 
## Introduction
This repository contains simple Pomodoro application made with Qt.
Pomodoro is well-known technique increasing productivity. It's very simple and it depends on dividing work in 'small'
intervals (work, short break and long break). This application helps to track those cycles.

## Customise 
This application is very simple, but it allows for customise of intervals times which can achieved thanks to settings widget

## Improvements
Things that can be done in order to make this application more robust and usable:
* make it installable (add exec to /usr, move settings file to some safe place, etc.)
* add icons for exec and notification window
* add sound alarm on transitions between modes
